logic :

Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the idea:

Take two pointers l and r. Initialize l to the starting index 0 and r to the last index N-1.
Since l is the first element, left_max would be 0, and right_max for r would be 0.
While l â‰¤ r, iterate the array. We have two possible conditions
Condition1 : left_max <= right max
Consider Element at index l
Since we have traversed all elements to the left of l, left_max is known 
For the right max of l, We can say that the right max would  always be >= current r_max here
So, min(left_max,right_max) would always equal to left_max in this case
Increment l.
Condition2 : left_max > right max
Consider Element at index r
Since we have traversed all elements to the right of r, right_max is known
For the left max of l, We can say that the left max would  always be >= current l_max here
So, min(left_max,right_max) would always equal to right_max in this case
Decrement r.

'''

Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
Output:
10
Explanation: 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
Output:
10
Explanation:
Water trapped by above 
block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 10 units.
